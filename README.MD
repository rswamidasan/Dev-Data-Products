This repo contains files relating to the course project in Developing Data Products, JHU Data Science, Coursera.

The project undertaken was to develop a shiny app to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

The files herein are: 

1. shiny App code: server.R, ui.R
2. RStudio Presenter file: CLT Explorer.Rpres, presentation slides (with embedded R code).

The shiny app can be run at the URl: https://rswamidasan.shinyapps.io/CLT-Explorer

The presentation may be viewed at URL: http://rpubs.com/robin_dasan/102897

**Users N.B.**: When viewing the Presentation slides on Rpubs, please open links in a ***New Tab***.

    (For some reason, when hosted on RPubs, opening the GitHub link doesn't work unless it's done in a
     New Tab.  It works fine with my local HTML file.)
